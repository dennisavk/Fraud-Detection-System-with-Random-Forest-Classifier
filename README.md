Fraud Detection using Machine Learning
Overview
This project demonstrates a simple fraud detection system using machine learning techniques. The goal of the project is to predict fraudulent transactions based on several features such as age, transaction amount, and location.

The fraud detection model is built using a Random Forest classifier, a popular machine learning algorithm for classification tasks. The project includes data preparation, model training, and evaluation, along with an explanation of the results.

Project Structure
The project folder is structured as follows:

bash
Copy code
fraud_detection_project/
├── fraud_detection.py            # The main script with your fraud detection logic
├── model_evaluation.txt         # Where model evaluation results will be stored
├── data/                        # Folder for datasets (optional if you use larger data files)
├── notebooks/                   # Jupyter notebooks (if used for analysis)
├── README.md                    # Documentation about your project
├── requirements.txt             # List of required Python libraries
fraud_detection.py
This is the main Python script containing the logic for fraud detection. It performs data manipulation, model training, and evaluation, and outputs the model's performance metrics.

model_evaluation.txt
The evaluation results of the model, including the classification report and confusion matrix, will be stored in this file.

data/
This folder contains the datasets you might use for training and testing the model. For simplicity, this project uses a simulated dataset, but you can replace it with a real-world dataset.

notebooks/
(Optional) If you use Jupyter notebooks for exploratory analysis, they can be placed in this folder.

requirements.txt
This file contains a list of Python libraries required to run the project. These include libraries for data processing (pandas, numpy), machine learning (scikit-learn), and visualization (matplotlib).

Installation
Clone this repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/dennisavk/Fraud-Detection-System-with-Random-Forest-Classifier
Set up a Python virtual environment (optional but recommended):

bash
Copy code
python3 -m venv fraud_detection_env
source fraud_detection_env/bin/activate   # On Windows: fraud_detection_env\Scripts\activate
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
How to Run
To run the fraud detection script and evaluate the model, follow these steps:

Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd fraud_detection_project
Run the main script:

bash
Copy code
python fraud_detection.py
This will run the fraud detection model on the simulated dataset, train the model, and output evaluation results such as precision, recall, F1-score, and the confusion matrix. These results will be saved in the model_evaluation.txt file.

Results
The script evaluates the model's performance using the following metrics:

Classification Report: Includes metrics like Precision, Recall, and F1-Score.
Confusion Matrix: Shows the number of correct and incorrect predictions (fraudulent vs. non-fraudulent).
Example of evaluation output:

lua

    accuracy                           0.92        10
   macro avg       0.95      0.90      0.92        10
weighted avg       0.93      0.92      0.92        10

Confusion Matrix:
[[3 0]
 [1 6]]
Future Enhancements
Model Improvement: Experiment with different machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, SVM, etc.) and hyperparameter tuning.
Larger Dataset: Use a more realistic and larger dataset to improve the model's performance.
Feature Engineering: Add more features (e.g., transaction time, customer history) for better fraud prediction.
Deployment: Build an API for real-time fraud detection and integrate it with a payment system.
